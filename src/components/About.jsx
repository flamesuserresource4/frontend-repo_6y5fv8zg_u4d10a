            Jessie brings a rich blend of floristry expertise, horticultural training, and project-management skill to every garden she nurtures. Her journey began at Wesley College (Class of 2011), followed by studies in Floristry at Manukau Institute of Technology (Class of 2015), where she first discovered her passion for plant artistry. She later expanded her knowledge through Level 2 Horticulture at MIT (2015) and advanced into Landscape & Horticulture (2017), sharpening her eye for outdoor design and plant health.

            In 2018, Jessie further strengthened her professional toolkit by completing Level 4 Business & Project Management at Te Wānanga o Aotearoa, giving her the ability to run her business with structure, care, and vision. She returned in 2022 to complete te reo Māori Level 1 & 2, embracing both the language and the tikanga connected to the land she works with daily.

          <p className="mt-4 text-black/80 leading-relaxed">
            Today, Jessie combines all of this knowledge to create thoughtful, beautiful, and thriving outdoor spaces through Grandiflora Garden Services. She brings heart, skill, and genuine pride to every garden she touches — making landscapes feel loved, intentional, and full of life.
